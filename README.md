# TH2_ezzell
Github repository:

This repository is a practice repository to demonstrate my ability to use the terminal on my laptop to push files onto my github repository. I will not be using this repository for my final project as I am working with Victoria, and we have a shared repository. I have a copy of that repository on my computer, and have already pushed some of my data for the project onto that repository.

I have pushed the following data onto the shared repository:

“BorderMetrics-Final.pdf” = A pdf which evaluates ways of measuring the flow of undocumented people crossing the southern border.

“GAO2017feb.pdf”= This GAO report details the current border control infrastructure such as type of barrier and miles of the barrier organized by border patrol sector. This report will be used to create a spreadsheet tracking this information.

I will continue to add data to the shared repository.

This practice repository has the following information:

“EzzellTHA1.pynb”= This is my first take home assignment. A more detailed description of the enclosed data is included in the colab file itself.

“gao_feb_2017.pdf”= This GAO report details the current border control infrastructure such as type of barrier and miles of the barrier organized by border patrol sector. This report will be used to create a spreadsheet tracking this information, which will be uploaded into the shared repository.

Research question:

The research question which we will be examining is the following: What is the effect of border control infrastructure and policy such as barriers, metering, personnel, on the smuggling prices of human smugglers who cross undocumented migrants across the U.S.-Mexico southern border as well as the flows of people crossing at particular parts of the border. In other words, does increased infrastructure increase or decrease the price that smugglers charge at that area of the border, and does increased infrastructure increase or decrease the number of people crossing in between ports of entry in each border patrol sector.
